I study physics at UNMSM and am currently working on my
[thesis](https://github.com/totallynotdavid/tesis), which involves earthquake simulation,
under the direction of Dr. César Jimenez.

I love building stuff. I've migrated a tsunami simulation from MATLAB to a modern web
architecture in under a month: [backend](https://github.com/totallynotdavid/picv-2025) &
[frontend](https://github.com/totallynotdavid/picv-2025-web). I've also built a
[bot](https://github.com/totallynotdavid/WhatsAppBot) for WhatsApp that somehow found its
way into 200+ groups and created [@caefisica](https://caefisica.com) to help fellow
undergrads survive.

I've learned from others' code and benefited from community-built tools, so I share my
work freely. Once a project is complete, I let it run and move on to the next thing. If
someone else can avoid the sleepless nights I had figuring things out, that's a win for
me.

I consider myself a designer at heart and enjoy building highly polished products. You can
see my design work at [Behance](https://www.behance.net/totallynotdavid).
